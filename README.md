# Deep Market Models

As a computer scientist, I know absolutely nothing about financial markets. But, over the course of the next few semesters, I hope to learn a little bit about how computational models can predict the movements of financial markets.

After being presented with a bunch of new data (mainly from finance.yahoo.com), I went in search of some LSTM implimentations. I found a good amount of discussion on kaggle [1]. So far, all I have done is collected a dataset and trained (over 5 epochs) a basic LSTM.

As I learn, I will impliment more than these Deep Market Models, but will look to benchmark and improve the initial LSTM.
